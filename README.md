# Gliner Model Deployment methods

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and examples for deploying the **Gliner Named Entity Recognition (NER) model**, with a primary focus on **NVIDIA's Triton Inference Server**. Additionally, it includes adaptable configurations and guidance for deploying Gliner on other compatible servers where supported.

## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to identify and classify entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and more. **Gliner**, a custom-built NER model, is designed to perform robust entity extraction with high accuracy and efficiency.

This repository contains:

- **Sample configuration files** for deploying Gliner with multiple backends.
- **Deployment scripts** to set up Gliner on Triton Server and other compatible servers.
- **Documentation** on optimizing and customizing your Gliner deployment for production.

## Features

- **Multi-backend support**: Sample configurations for various backends (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX).
- **Flexible deployment**: Guidance for setting up Triton Server as well as instructions for other server options where applicable.
- **Efficient inference**: Tips for optimizing inference speed and resource usage.
- **Scalable deployment**: Designed to work seamlessly with Triton and other scalable production environments.

## Getting Started

To deploy the Gliner model, clone this repository and follow the instructions for setting up Triton Server or another compatible server with the backend of your choice.
